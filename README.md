* The application must include at least two main components (see the figure above for an example of the application): ✅
1) Vertical list with names of TODO notes;
2) TODO note interaction area;  
* Implement the ability to add, edit and delete TODO notes; ✅  
* Trim the end of the TODO note name “…” if the name does not fit into the vertical list of TODO note names. ✅

## Additional goals:

* Add color indication of progress status of TODO notes execution (states: pending/in progress/completed); ✅  
* Add TODO notes search by name; ✅  
* Add the ability to change the width of the list of names of TODO notes by holding and moving the right border with the mouse cursor; ✅ 
* Implement an application in React+JS or React+TS (preferably use createReactApp https://create-react-app.dev/); ✅
